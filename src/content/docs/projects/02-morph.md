title: Morphological Inflections
description: RNN-based morphological inflection predictor with baseline comparison
---

## About the Project

Implemented a morphological inflection prediction system using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The system learns patterns in word inflections and compares performance against traditional baseline metrics.

[`GitHub`](https://github.com/bitmap4/morphological-inflections)

## Features

- RNN-based sequence learning
- Character-level prediction
- Multiple languages support
- Comparative analysis with baseline methods
