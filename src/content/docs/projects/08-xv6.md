description: System call implementations and custom schedulers for XV6
---

## About the Project

Enhanced the XV6 operating system with new system calls and scheduling policies. Implemented:
- System call tracking functionality
- Process timer alerts
- Lottery-based scheduling
- Multi-level feedback queue scheduling

[`GitHub`](https://github.com/bitmap4/xv6-mods)

## Features

### System Calls
- `getSysCount`: Tracks system call usage statistics
- `sigalarm`/`sigreturn`: Process CPU time alerts 
- `settickets`: Sets process lottery tickets

### Schedulers
- **Lottery Based Scheduling (LBS)**
  - Random ticket-based process selection
  - Process arrival time prioritization
  - Inherited ticket counts for child processes

- **Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ)**
  - 4 priority queues with different time slices
  - Priority boosting to prevent starvation
  - I/O-bound process prioritization
